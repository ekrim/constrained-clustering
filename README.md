# constrained-clustering


The repository contains the code for the constrained clustering work from my Ph.D. at the Computational NeuroEngineering Lab at the University of Florida. It will be updated with additional work to serve as an easily deployable constrained clustering toolbox.

Check the ipython notebook intro.ipynb for a quick demo.
