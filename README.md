# constrained-clustering


The repository contains the code for the constrained clustering work from my Ph.D. at the Computational NeuroEngineering Lab at the University of Florida. It will be updated with additional work to serve as an easy to implement constrained clustering toolbox.

Check the ipython notebooks in the examples folder for a guided tutorial.
