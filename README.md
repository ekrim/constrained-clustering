# Constrained clustering under uncertainty 

The repository contains the code for the constrained clustering work from my PhD at the Computational NeuroEngineering Lab at the University of Florida. It will be updated with additional work to serve as an easy to implement constrained clustering toolbox.

Check the notebooks in the examples folder for a guided tutorial.
